TestNodeLeave
    This test the senario when a known peer is downed. Since the kademlia server is runned forever, we need to test with a external executing instance. For now, we manually run and close the remote peer.
    We didn't implement the pausing feature, instead, we relies on the debugger to pause the process so we have time to operate on the remote peer.
    Executing this directly will result in error. Since the remote peer is not set.
